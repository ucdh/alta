In Python, a string is a type of data we may use. Other types of data we might encounter are integers, booleans (True/False), lists, and sets. Data types can share properties, and may have certain types of functions that can use them in common. For instance, a string like \"The Gold Bug\" can be sliced, or it can be looped over to examine each character one by one. Similarly, a list of words, ```['The', 'Gold', 'Bug']``` can be sliced or looped over.\n",

We call such specific functions \"methods\" - in this case it is a string method. ```string.find(\"a sub string\")``` specifies a string type object, then uses the find method to search for a given sub string. ```len()``` could be used with a range of numbers or other types of objects, so we don't need to attach it after a string object to use it.\n",
