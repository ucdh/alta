Second, we'll choose the Markdown option from the format menu (that by default is set to ```Code```) and type in ```# Hello World```.

    "Now on to writing our _Hello World!_ program. The first challenge is to figure out which command to use to print and the syntax needed to specify our string. We're not doing a full (or even partial) tutorial on Python here, so it's really just a matter of finding a practical solution, even if we haven't fully covered all the concepts (like commands, arguments, strings, output). Let's just Google [python 3 print string](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=python+3+print+string) – your results may vary, but the top result for me is a link to the Python 3 Documentation Tutorial on [Input and Output](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html) which refers to the built-in [print()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) function.\n",

In computing terms, a string is a series of characters, and it is represented in Python by wrapping it in quotation marks. So in its simplest form, we can send one string input, wrapped in quote marks, to the print() function by putting it inside the parentheses.\n",

Another powerful feature is the creation of lists. For instance, we can create an HTML list by having an asterisk in front of every item (you can copy the first section and evaluate the mark down to get the second section, note the use of hyphens -- (at least two are needed) under the first line to create a sub-heading using a different strategy than using a # character):\n",
